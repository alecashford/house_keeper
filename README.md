#HouseKeeper
===

Have you ever had difficulty coordinating finances between roommates? HouseKeeper is expressly for you. HouseKeeper was designed to offer a simple yet essential service in an interface anyone can figure out. Users can add common utilities, which are divided evenly by the number of roommates, or can add expenditures that they spent on behalf of the house, in which case their subtotal is lowered and the rest of their roommateâ€™s subtotals are raised by a proportional amount. The formula is intended to equalize the total amount of money each roommate pays into the house, so that no one is paying more or less than they owe.
